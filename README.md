hands-on-discovery
==================

Let's make a discovery-enabled web service!

There are a couple of possible starting points:

1. Leon's contributed a skeleton REST server, rest.js.

   a. Try adding a discovery rest endpoint to it - you can start with the restAPI.json I started.

   b. Make the server do something!

2. Pick your favorite underserved API (which would be pretty much any of them).

   a. Write a discovery rest document for it.

   b. Try it out!
